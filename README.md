**Multi modular structure** : Not actaully used but just to show concept and hierarchy 

                              Common Module : acts as a library and its dependency added to other modules
                              
                              Feature Module : acts as a separate Feature APK
                              
                              App Module : separate APK as well

**Unit testing** : Local unit testing using Mockito and Junit was used for coroutines test
